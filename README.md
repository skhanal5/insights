# Insights

## About
* This project was made so I get better at making a responsive frontend and learn more about implementing a serverless backend. It is an extension of a project that I made that did not take into consideration/fully implement the above.
* Frontend made using React, Tailwind, Shadcn, and RadixUI
* Backend made using API Gateway, Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB

## Project Preview

### General Demo (Soon)

### Mobile Demo (Soon)

## Features
* Users can add and query job applications via search, column, etc.
* Users can export their job applications to a CSV or an Excel sheet
* Dashboard allows users to see an overall view of their job search performance
