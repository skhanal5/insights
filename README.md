# Insights

## About
* This project was made so I get better at making a responsive frontend and learn more about implementing a serverless backend. It is an extension of a project that I made that did not take into consideration/fully implement the above.
* Frontend made using Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, Shadcn, and RadixUI
* Backend made using API Gateway, Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB
